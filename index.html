            <h3>"Reasons Why My Dad Is the Best" - an essay written by: Bruce Altshuller</h3>
            <p>
                My dad, Stan Altshuller, is the best dad in the world. And, I will be explaining why. He has so many cool hobbies like flying drones, drinking coffee, swimming, hiking, and biking, and even skiing! He always works his hardest to earn money for the family and teaches us new things. I think it’s awesome that he knows how to fly drones.

            <p>
                Every morning, he drinks coffee after making the whole entire family of 5 breakfeast. His favorite color is gray, which I think is really cool because it's such a unique favorite color. I think that he might as well like silver more, because it's just gray but better, but it it his opinion in the end! Also, my dad, Stan Altshuller, is really strong and good at math, reading, science, literature, drama, Language arts, etc. He always helps me study and teaches me how to be a better person. We go swimming in the summer and he likes hiking a lot.
            </p>
            <p>
                I love my dad because he always makes time for our family and he is always there when I need him. He’s my hero and I hope to be just like him when I grow up.
